In the Demo/Scenes folder of DeepStats you will find two folders:
1. Samples can be used as a guide for how to build with DeepStats.
2. Tests contains a Stress Test you can use on your own platform to ensure you're getting the performance you want.

The Demos require all of the ScriptableObjects defined in the DeepStats Configuration folder, as well as the latest code generated from the demo DeepStatsConfiguration object. If you make any changes to the Demo Stat Configuration, most likely the demos will stop working. It's worth having a quick browse of this folder to familiarise yourself with what has been configured if you want to understand the demos further.
